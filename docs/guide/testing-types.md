# Testing Types

Vitest allows you to write tests for your types, using `expectTypeOf` or `assertType` syntaxes. By default all tests inside `*.test-d.ts` files are considered type tests, but you can change it with [`typechecker.include`](/config/#typechecker-include) config option.

Under the hood Vitest calls `tsc` or `vue-tsc`, depending on your config, and parses results. Vitest will also print out type errors in your source code, if it finds any. You can disable it with [`typechecker.ignoreSourceErrors`](/config/#typechecker-ignoresourceerrors) config option.

Keep in mind that Vitest doesn't run or compile these files, they are only statically analyzed by the compiler, and because of that you cannot use any dynamic statements in test names, for example.

```ts
import { assertType, expectTypeOf } from 'vitest'
import { mount } from './mount.js'

test('my types work properly', () => {
  expectTypeOf(mount).toBeFunction()
  expectTypeOf(mount).parameter(0).toMatchTypeOf<{ name: string }>()

  // @ts-expect-error name is a string
  assertType(mount({ name: 42 }))
})
```

Any type error triggered inside a test file will be treated as a test error, so you can use any type trick you want to test types of your project.

You can see a list of possible matchers in [API section](/api/#expecttypeof).
