# Vitest UI

Powered by Vite, Vitest also has a dev server under the hood when running the tests. This allows Vitest to provide a beautiful UI to view and interact with your tests. The Vitest UI is optional, you can install it by:

```bash
npm i -D @vitest/ui
```

Then you can start the tests with UI by passing the `--ui` flag:

```bash
vitest --ui
```

Then you can visit the Vitest UI at <a href="http://localhost:51204/__vitest__/">`http://localhost:51204/__vitest__/`</a>
